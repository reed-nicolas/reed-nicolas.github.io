Hello, I am Nicolas Reed. I am an EECS (Electrical Engineering & Computer Sciences) student at UC Berkeley with experience in systems and hardware.

I currently serve as a Head Teaching Assistant for [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org/). I am incoming to Apple in Summer 2026 as an SEG (Silicon Engineering Group) Intern, focused on SoC Design Verification Engineering. I previously completed a Software Development Internship at Sandisk, where I analyzed infrastructure and license data at scale. I also conduct research in the [UC Berkeley SLICE Lab](https://slice.eecs.berkeley.edu/) under [Professor Sagar Karandikar](https://sagark.org/), improving usability in the Chipyard and FireSim hardware development frameworks. In the past, I served as a TA for [UC Berkeleyâ€™s Machine Structures course](https://cs61c.org/).
