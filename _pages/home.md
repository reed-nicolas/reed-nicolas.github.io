Hello, I'm Nicolas Reed. I'm an Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) student at UC Berkeley with experience in systems and hardware.

I recently completed a Software Development Internship at Sandisk, where I analyzed infrastructure and license data at scale. I also conduct research in the [UC Berkeley SLICE Lab](https://slice.eecs.berkeley.edu/) under [Professor Sagar Karandikar](https://sagark.org/), improving usability in the Chipyard and FireSim hardware development frameworks. Moreover, I currently serve as a TA for [UC Berkeley's Machine Structures course](https://cs61c.org/).
